-- | Starting from a flat 'OpTree' (i.e. a n-ary tree of depth 1,

-- sub-trees (according to the fixity info carried by the nodes).
--
-- We have two complementary ways to build the proper sub-trees:
--
-- * if we can find a set of operators "minOps" at the current level where
--     forall (op1, op2) \in minOps x minOps, op1 `equal` op2
--     forall (op1, op2) \in minOps x (opsOfCurrentLevel \ minOps),
--       op1 `lessThan` op2
--   then we can build a subtree with the exprs and ops located "between"
--   each element of minOps.
--   For example, if minOps = {op0, op2, op5},
--   and if [...] means "extract a subtree", then
--   currentLevel =
--     [ex0 op0 ex1 op1 ex2 op2 ex3 op3 ex4 op4 ex5 op5 ex6 op6 ex7]
--   will become
--     [ex0 op0 [ex1 op1 ex2] op2 [ex3 op3 ex4 op4 ex5] op5 [ex6 op6 ex7]]
-- * if we can find a set of operators "maxOps" at the current level where
--     forall (op1, op2) \in maxOps x maxOps, op1 `equal` op2
--     forall (op1, op2) \in maxOps x (opsOfCurrentLevel \ maxOps),
--       op1 `greaterThan` op2
--   then we can build a subtree with every contiguous range of elements
--   from maxOps (and the exprs on their sides)
--   For example, if maxOps = {op0, op1, op4},
--   and if [...] means "extract a subtree", then
--   currentLevel =
--     [ex0 op0 ex1 op1 ex2 op2 ex3 op3 ex4 op4 ex5 op5 ex6 op6 ex7]
--   will become
--     [[ex0 op0 ex1 op1 ex2] op2 ex3 op3 [ex4 op4 ex5] op5 ex6 op6 ex7]
--
-- We will also recursively apply the same logic on every sub-tree built
-- during the process. The two principles are not overlapping and thus are
-- required, because we are comparing precedence level ranges. In the case
-- where we can't find a non-empty set {min,max}Ops with one logic or the
-- other, we finally try to split the tree on “hard splitters” if there is
-- any.
